<p align = 'justify'>
  Long before GPS and algorithms, explorers had just one reliable guide in the vast, star-studded sky— <b>Polaris</b>, the North Star. No matter how wild the storm or dark the night, Polaris pointed the way. That’s exactly what Project Polaris aims to be: a bright, unwavering signal in the messy universe of hiring. In a world of endless résumés, guesswork, and generic filters, Polaris doesn’t just scan—it discovers. It finds the spark, the potential, the perfect match that others miss. This isn’t just a hiring system; it’s your cosmic compass for finding extraordinary talent.
